# News-Analysis

The following project is built with an intention to help in the analysis of the coverage of various media outlets.
We try to count the number of articles a given media has dedicated to a given topic.
We hypothesize that if the article is about a given subject, that words most likely exists in the title of the article.
As in the following case, we assume if the article is about covid, the words COVID or COVID-19 or CORONA VIRUS etc would be present in the title.
